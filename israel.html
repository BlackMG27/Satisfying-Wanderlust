			<p>I went to Israel for 10 months  after I graduated high school. It was a program that is a cultural part of the Jewish community. It is a five year program.</p>

				<p>It was so surreal. I read about it my whole life, and it felt so good. When the plane landed everyone was clapping and some kissed the ground.</p>

				<p>The people; its very different. Strangers are just friends that you’ve haven’t met yet. It is a sense of unity. “Israel one nation with one heart.“ People undestand that they atre part of something bigger. </p>

				<p>It was year of self-reflection to know who you are as a person. It was a time for me to learn a lot and grow. It was a place for me to clear my mind and think about your time before going into the real world. I feel that Chicago is a loud city and Israel gave me a chace to clear and collect my thoughts.</p>

				<p>It strengthend my connection to my culture and religion and my social skills. When I was in Israel, I had to find my own voice. I was really timid in high school, and Israel helped me to get out of my comfort zone. </p>

				<p>I would have stayed for a second year. There  was an option to staty. Other than that I have no regrets.  </p>

				<p>The year there ws the most important time of my life. A Gap year is imposrtant becasue it gives you a chance to take a breather before college and everything else that is waitiong for you on the other side. “Like the calm before the storm”. </p>
