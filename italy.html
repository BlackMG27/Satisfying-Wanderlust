			<p>I went to Italy as a part of in UIC’s Italian Culture and the Arts in Siena Faculty-Led Study Abroad program for six weeks. After the program, I went to Paris for five days by myself.</p>

				<p>I felt like I was dropped into a semi-time warp. We were picked up from the airport in Rome by our main professor and the busride was one for my journal. Rome was amazing; it was the first time that I saw the ancient and the semi-modern exist. Chicago’s oldest buildings are from the mid 1800s, and it was nice to see an ancient Roman acquduct and a Moped in one shot. </p>

				<p>Let me stick to Siena because I spent the most time there. The Senese are extremely close knit by American standards. They identify as Senese first, then Italian. The closest I’ve come is how some Nigerians (my parents and little brother are from Nigeria) identify with their tribe (ethnic group), then their country or say that they’re Nigerian-American. Antoher thing that I noticed was pace people went about their day. Italians seem to value leisure a lot more than Americans. They like to take their time (at least more than most Americans) to cook; it’s like an unforgetable experience instead of a chore. </p>

				<p>I was scared and excited at first. I was the first person in my family to go to Europe, but I was going in with little knowledge about the place. After a few days, I just explored my surroundings always taking pictures with my camera. It helped me appreciate my time there and as a bonus it made for great conversation. </p>

				<p>I did a great deal of self-reflection in Italy. I thought a lot of how and if humanity has mature after visiting a torture museum in San Giminano, or how the United States could improve itself after comparing various things such as transportation, conservation, education, and work vs. leisure. In a way, it was a sobering experience in how I view the United States. I learned that the US has fallen behind on some of the most basic things a society needs. I realized that I knew I lot less about the world that I thought and that it’s good to be a little ignorant, it means you’re growing.</p>

				<p>I learned to be more critical of the policy decisions made by my government. While I was abroad, I started thinking about where our resources could go to make the United States better, and it frustrates me that we can’t do the most basic things. I learned to be more open-minded for the fact that everyone does not and will not think like you. You have to own up to your mistakes, and it is a lot easier to do that when you are by yourself in a foreign country. </p>

				<p>You are able to (sorry if this sounds corny) make new friends and experiences, humbles you on your supposed importance in the world, and you might become a storyteller, but it cannot be yours if you don’t try. I’ll leave you with the words of Andre Gide, “Man cannot discover new oceans unless he has the courage to lose sight of the shore.”</p>
