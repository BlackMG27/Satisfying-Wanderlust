			<p>People, for the most part, love travel, or maybe the idea of travel. It is glorified in movies, books, and magazines. Celebrities always seem to be going everywhere, and why not? Traveling is fun. You get to a new place, have new experiences that last and like Helen Keller once said, “Life is either a daring adventure or nothing”. So why don’t more people travel? For most/many in the professional world it would be a problem due to responsibilities and lack of vacation time, but what about students, or people who are under twenty-five?</p>

			<p>Well in the United States, the likelihood of someone traveling abroad without his/her family before leaving university is slim. According to the Institute of International, only two percent of students study abroad and internships/volunteering abroad only had 22,181 participants for 2013/2014 despite the fact these programs are highly valued by employers. So again, why don’t more teens and young adults travel abroad before entering the professional world?</p>

			<p>Many attribute this dilemma to lack of time and money, which is understandable because a standard six week summer program could set you back about $7,000-8,000 including airfare, which begs the question, is it worth it?</p>

			<p>Short Answer: Most likely yes.</p>

				<p>In her thesis titled, <i>Career Impact and Professional Applicability of the Study Abroad Experience</i>, Kimberly Franklin conducted phone and email interviews with the alumni who were identified by the Dickenson College’s Office of the Registrar, Institutional Research, and Global Research (Franklin 171). Her goal was to see if and how study abroad has long-term impact in terms of professional development. </p>

				<p>She found that forty-three of the fifty-two participants agreed that their experience affected their careers. Moreover, the survey found that the Dickenson alumni who studied had a higher than national average 
				yearly earnings (Men: 59,332 vs. 122,333 and Women: 45,136 vs. 71,144) though it might not be a direct 
				link between their experience abroad and higher earnings (Franklin 180).</p> 

				<p>Another area participants agreed on was that their time abroad gave them more leverage in the job market. Representatives responded that language, cross-cultural communication, having diversity on a resume, and experience living abroad has made them more employable. The RAND Corporation survey supports this by finding that employers value inter-culturalcompetency and interpersonal skills when looking at job applications (Franklin 181). Seventy-two percent of the participants agreed that their experience abroad has helped them better understand situations in a cultural context (Franklin 182). This is not surprising since the business world is in high demand for people who can pick up, analyze, and solve problems in a cultural/global context. </p>

				<p>Franklin’s research also found that sixty percent of the respondents agreed that their time abroad has influenced their sense of professional ethics. One respondent commented, “When you work with people from other cultures, you really begin to understand the ethics that drive their disposition.”</p>

				<p>Lastly, Franklin’s research covered Intercultural Competence with overwhelming support for the notion that spending time abroad gave them expertise in intercultural competencies. </p>

				<p>A majority of the participants agreed that the knowledge they gained abroad could be applied to their professional work. Additionally, the lion share of participants agreed that they had greater self-awareness from their time abroad. Another 67.3% of participants agreed that the skill of being able to cross-culturally communicate and relate to others while studying abroad has helped them professionally (this was the most popular theme of the survey due to the open-ended nature of the question) (Franklin 184). One alumnus replied, “My study abroad experience has enhanced my communication skills, allowed me to become more open-minded, and have a greater understanding of people in relation to their environment, culture, and country. ” </p>

				<p>It is usually true that one develops strong interpersonal skills when removed from familiar surroundings. This is further attested with the number of participants who agreed with the alumnus’ comments.</p>

				<p>Another form of traveling abroad that has gained some traction for Americans in recent years is backpacking/taking a gap year. But why? This type of travel offers less structure offers less structure and independence to potential travelers who might think tourism as “boring” and “part of the mainstream”.  Yet, wouldn’t this disdain for taking “the normal route” be a little ironic for such travelers considering its rise in popularity?</p>

				<p>In the paper, <i>From Drifter to Gap Year Tourist: Mainstreaming Backpacker Travel</i>, Camille O’Reilly identifies backpacking through three broad characteristics: the length of time on the road, the mode of travel, and the orientation towards the task of 
				travel. Basically, backpackers welcome serendipity, meaning that they like to have little to no advance planning and have an openness to change of plan or itinerary (O’Reilly 999).</p>

				<p>This may seem as sharp turn from the more traditional means of travel due to the fact that many backpackers dislike having the term “tourist” applied to them. Yet some could this a little pompous considering that when one enters another country, you are usually considered a foreigner and a ‘tourist’ if you will, given the history of the backpacker.</p>

				 <p>‘Backpacking’, in the sense of what we think of today, can be traced back to other forms of travel that was started with European exploration with fantasies of meeting the “Other” and being the brave explorer, all without caring for the condition and culture of the ‘natives’ they seek out (O’Reilly 1003).  This could be attributed the ‘wild adventure stories’ of the explorers that went before them in similar manner of the travel books and blogs of today.  ‘Backpacking’ could also be traced to the Grand Tour of the 17th and 18th centuries that was used as a means of acquiring knowledge through experiences and becoming a more cultured individual (O’Reilly 1004). This could be seen today as means of self-reflection that many backpackers encounter during their travels. Sometime in the ‘60s and ‘70s there was a rise in “drifter” tourism to countries such as India that is probably (in some aspects) the forerunner for modern backpack travel. Drifters have no time limit, a tight wallet, and are more likely to be a risk taker (O’Reilly 1004). These attributes may have taken a backseat to the more mainstream version an in effect, devalued the backpacking experience more than most backpackers today are willing to admit. </p>

				<p>What backpackers will say is how their travels have changed them, most likely for the better. Travelers such as Alan, who was an Australian backpacker who was traveling for 18 months, realized that his time away from everyone has made him more confident in his own identity and more observant of subtle interactions (O’Reilly 1010). Other backpackers have similar traits such as: tolerance of different cultures/beliefs, global awareness, a sense of common humanity, and the ability to see their own country’s role in the world in a cultural/political sense (O’Reilly 1012).  Additionally, backpackers could become adept storytellers and communicators through journaling and writing to loved ones (O’Reilly 1013). These skills can be easily transferable in our ever-changing world. </p>

				<p>For my research, I interviewed eight people from the United States who traveled to countries ranging from Denmark to Japan. I wanted to get a first-hand account of their whole experience and not a snapshot. The interviews were done via online, over the phone, and in person. Each person was given twelve questions about their experience and whether they would recommend it. These interviews were then stripped down to quotes that summarized their experiences. </p>
