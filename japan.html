				<p>The school had arranged for a Japanese student to pick me up at the airport, so having someone there the moment I landed was very comforting. One surprise I had on the bus was that the Japanese also have their own style of graffiti - and given the fact that most people overseas consider all Japanese to be perfect and well-behaved, it was nice to see a touch of rebellion! </p>

				<p>Before I even arrived at the dorm, the Japanese student who brought me to the school immediately took me to a store to buy a pair of indoor slippers. I had already known about this custom, but I didn’t think I would be reminded before I even settled in! </p>

				<p>It was very scary at first. Once the Japanese student dropped me off at the dorm, I found most girls and staff in the dorm did not speak English. My roommate, who was from Hawaii, had not yet arrived, and the staff and students were trying to get me to sign forms 100% in Japanese. </p>

				<p>It was the first time I gone overseas. It was also the first time I had flown on a plane by myself - and for 15 hours total with a lay over, no less! I felt more confident in my ability to operate independently. I had also learned more about the world first-hand by meeting students all across Asia.</p>

				<p>I gained one very close friend, who even 6 months later, I still talk to daily. That is the greatest treasure of my trip. I also finally traveled to my dream place, and now I feel a deeper connection to the country. I had a chance to also practice my Japanese, and to learn more about other cultures from the other exchange students. I also made friends with a Japanese student, who a few months later, came to visit me in Chicago. It was fun to show him around the city, after he had done the same for me in Japan!</p>

				<p>It was a fantastic experience! The program is called ‘Tokai Cool Japan’, and it was extremely affordable. It’s probably the cheapest way for a student to travel to Japan. I would have loved to study abroad for longer, and I would definitely recommend that.
