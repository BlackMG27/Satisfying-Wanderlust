			<h2>Stephanie Sattler</h2>
			<p>I studied abroad for a semester and went back for work. I stayed in Ireland for a total of 5 1/2 years. I spent most of my twenties in Ireland. It was less stressful for me, and it gave me more time to explore. </p>

				<p>I came in January and left at a different time. I met everyone at orientation, but I soon left my American friends for Irish friends. I was the only American in my accomidations. It took me awhile to get used to new things like water. In Ireland, you only heat the amount you need yourself. I locked myself outside of my room while I waited for the hot water in my towel. It taught me to laugh at myself and to not be so hard on myself. I ended up sitting by the window singing while I waited for my American friends (2 men). I learned to be more positive with my experiences. I called for my friends to get the key to let me in. It was all fine. 
				</p>
				<p>I learned that people are different and that is good and people are also the same, and that is also good. Humanity shares the same essential problems and strengths. The Irish go at a slower pace and is more relational as opposed to the productivity based society in the United States. The tourist fear can be seen as one does not want to be seen as incompetent, but you are new and everything is a brand new experience. I would have a lot of reflective moments with things that would be commonplace to most people. I took back being more respectful of resources. Like my experices with hot water and using a dryer. I feel that conservation in Europe is better than in the US.</p>

				<p>There’s nothting I regret, so I don’t know what I would diffrently. I guess I would have been more open-minded and less judgmental, “It’s just diffrent“. I met a couple from the US who kept complaining about how diifferent Ireland was from the US. I was just thinking about how much she was missing in her experience. That ‘s the thing with study abroad, “You are a sponge.” Sometimes to be in the relationship of just eating is different; it’s much slower and more relaxed.</p>
				<p>Being able to challenge your self, open your souroundings, becoming more flexible and open-midied and “my way isn’t always the right way“ and realzing that Americans don’t have everything. It is a maturing experience. It a life-changing mind-boggling experice that opens so many doors. </p>
