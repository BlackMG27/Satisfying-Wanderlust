				<p>I dind’t know what to expect. I did some reearch on Google, but I was a little scared. I definently felt a langage barrier and how people behaved. They did not ask how there day was. I arrived sick; my throat was sore and I got a headache. It was a twelve hour flight with 2 stops. It felt like I couldn’t  commmunicate with anyone beside Americans or people who knew English.</p>

				<p>I studied traditional Chinese medicine and Madarin. Chinese Medicine focuses on herbal tea and its uses. We also focused on acupucture and massage. We got to practice on each other. The Mandarin class was an intense course.</p>

				<p>In terms of traffic the roads are over filled with cars and scooters (they have their own lane). There are bikes and you can be walking on sidewalk and a motorcycle. In the park people would be practicing tai chi and meditate. Food, chopsticks and rice and noodles are huge. Business aspect are similatr (fast-food and Walmart), but it is rare to find someone who speaks English. Health; they use Western medicine in China with traditional chinese medicine (traditional hospital). they believe in preventative care. </p>

				<p>At times, I was frustrated with language barrier, but It felt cool to be 1000s miles away from home. When I ws in Hong Kong, I had a twelve hour layover. rented hotel and took subway and made mini excurisons. I felt confident and frustrated at times.</p>

				<p>I learned how to talk to people who were of diffrent cultural backgrounds. I learned to pick up on body language, tone of voice, and hand gestures. I also learned to take risks; I took a risk with the train in Hong Kong, I could’ve missed my flight. </p>

				<p>Traveling is an oppurtunity to learn about your self and leave the American lifestyle and relax. US is really busy and you get in a cycle. It is a time to reflect and think about your future because you have less responsibilites. </p>
