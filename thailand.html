				<p>When I arrived, I felt a little sense of familiarity, in a way a sense of home. This is due to my mixed Asian heritage. Although, before my class and I traveled, we met up with our professor for a short class meeting. He gave us tips, and told us to be mindful of our mannerisms. In other words, not to me too American (just kidding). He basically reminded us to be polite and mindful of our actions, and for look for each other as well as our belongings (keeping an eye out for pick pockets).</p>

				<p>In other words, this thought be to learn to be patient when things do not go as planned, and for me to put aside my “American attitude” of impatience when it comes to say, waiting in line to make a purchase. I also, reminded myself that in general, the Asian attitude is, for the most part, to be polite and show the least amount of frustration. Hence, I had to switch gears toward my Asian side when it came dealing with certain situations. In other words, don’t lose face. </p>

				<p>I have always been brought up to be polite. Yet, growing up with my Americanized surroundings, I was taught to be aggressive. At that time, I had to switch over to my Asian-Pacific upbringing (since I was in Asia anyway). As it turned out, politeness comes a long way when it came to communicating with the locals, especially when there are some language barriers. Then again, politeness goes a long way anywhere you go.  </p>

				<p>The experience has opened my mind to so many things. It also gave me the motivation to continue exploring what the world has to offer by broadening my horizons. Also, with meeting many people all over the world, they help me see the rest of the world through multiple lenses. In other words, I try to see perspectives of people who are from different cultures than my own.</p>

				<p>I felt as though I have gained more knowledge of other cultures from within the countries of origin. Yes, the U.S. has many people of many cultures, and yes, I have seen and experienced them through my friends.Yet, seeing and experiencing them up-close from their origin in a way gave me the validation. Not that I did not believe my friends, but in a way, it prepared me understand why people do the things they do (depending on their upbringing). </p>

				<p>I would definitely recommend it. Traveling and learning about cultures will not only educate others about cultural differences, but also get them to become culturally sensitive to people who are different from themselves. </p>
