			<h2>Savanna Campoli</h2>
			<p>I went to London, England to study graphic design at the University of Arts London, Central St. Martins. I went there for about four 
			   months and spent an extra two weeks traveling after my studies. </p>

				<p>I was extremely excited and scared at the same time. I’ve travelled a lot but moving to a new place with no family is probably one of the scariest things you can do as a person. I thought London was going to be this grand city and that i would know exactly where everything was based of my prior studies, but the street systems and driving were so vastly different that I felt utterly lost just driving in the cab to my new apartment.
				</p>
				<p>It honestly reminded me more of Canada than it did America. All the street names were very similar to Canadian street names which was pretty exciting for me. London is far more fast paced that Chicago, which was a cultural adjustment on its own. People were also pretty reserved in England and they definitly kept to their own. When we got lost or tried to ask for direction it was a bit hard finding somebody who would help us because they were busy with their own lives. </p>

				<p>Im going to be honest, I lost myself for a bit when i was there. The schooling system was very different that american school and i struggled alot with some of my classes. The teachers were pushing us very hard to have the greatest most conceptual ideas and quite frankly i had no idea what conceptual design was. I got incredibly homesick the first two months that my parents almost sent me home. My only solice was traveling, I would spend 5 day weekends in different countries learning about different cultures which is probably one of my favourite things to do in general.</p>

				<p>I learned that I complain a lot. haha But I also learned that I am a very dedicated, talent, strong individual. Not many can go through some of the experiences I have been through and being on my own for a bit really taught me that I can actually do it.</p>

				<p>Not so much that I grew as a person, but that I felt that I learned more of my capabilites as a human being. I dont think we really change or grow in non physical ways, but that we gain new knowledge that help us to make better decisions. Or something more phillosophical than that! </p>

				<p>Its so thrilling to be on your own, make your own decisions and create an adventure for yourself. I believe we all need trips like these to fully understand who we are as people.</p>
