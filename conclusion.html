				<p>The point of this thesis was to give young Americans some options on travel and its benefits, but it turned into how much we can and probably should value stories. </p>

				<p>Travel is just one way of telling a story, but it’s a way that can help one reach his/her biggest potential without being encumbered by one’s daily lives. It helps people listen to stories that they might never encountered in their influence spheres or online.</p>
				<p>Travel just moves you, and it is something that, thankfully, will 
				only grow in popularity as more people learn what stories they can tell.</p>
