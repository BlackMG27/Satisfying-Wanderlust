# Satisfying-Wanderlust
Graphic Design Thesis Capstone

This thesis project was inspired by my time studying abroad in Italy during the summer between my junior and senior year. During the fall semester, I did some research into the liklihood of teens and young adults traveling abroad, and was a little dismayed, but not completely surprised of my findings. I wanted to make people more aware of the opportunites which led to this project.

I interviewed eight people who have traveled abroad between one to ten years ago. They could have studied abroad, interned/worked abroad, or had a gap year abroad.

For the webiste, I modified a jQuery map so that when you click on one of the higlighted countries, you go to the student's webpage.
