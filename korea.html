				<p>When I fist got there I felt like I was in the future. THe infrastructure is similar, but is very different. It’s like built with twenty or thirty floors, so that was unexpected. I already had some idea about Korea since I watch a lot of Korean films, TV and music. I didn’t think it was going to be like that.</p>

				<p>They help you get use to the Korean culture, They show you around, and they have programs, like a mentoring program where you can pair up with a Korean student which was nice. </p>

				<p>It’s completely different. The language was barrier to me, but Korean culture is similar to my second culture, which I admire. Koreans have a sense of respect and hierarchy that many in the United States do not have. I do. I don’t feel like everyone is equal and you should show respect to your elders, and I believe that this asprect has been lost on the US. I grew up in Mexico and I do like their culture.  </p>

				<p>I did not feel Korean. It’s doesn’t matter how long you’ve been in Korea; if you weren’t born in Korean, then you’re not Korean beacause you don’t look like them. When I arrived, everyone thought I was a Westerner, in paticular Spaniard (which I hated). They don’t knowlegde about the West and vice versa. I had to keep telling people that I am Mexican, I was raised in Mexico and now I live in the States. You learn and it was a good experience. You learn more about who your are and your identity.</p>

				<p>You dont feel it, but I’m sure I did. I was alone and I talked to my friends and family, but it was hard due to the time difference. You meet a lot of different people. I don’t think I would have met so many people. I met people from all over the world. Everyone I met in Korea had such a different story than my own whereas all of my friend here are the same. You learn a lot from your friends. </p>

				<p>I would definetly recommend it because everyday here is the same. You wake up, go to school and work and you go home. In Korea, there is always something to do. At the community center near my house, they had Italian opera, Beer festivals, strip performances. You get to learn that the United States is not the center of the unvierse. </p>
