			<p>I went to Copenhagen, Denmark for seven weeks as part of the DIS Study abroad in Scandinavia for furniture design. Then I traveled around Europe for a month afterwards. </p>

				<p>It was a whole study abroad DIS, architecture, graphic, furniture, and industrial design. Each program had 20-30 students in each course, and all of us got to be able to meet each other, but we were linked within our paticular course. We had study tours and planned events. We had time off and we were able to meet whoever you wanted.</p>

				<p>Most of the things that I noticed were that the Danes were more reserved. You had to introduce yourself to them. They were a lot more friendly, actually making time for them. They wanted to take their time and create a relationship. They take a lot more time, whereas in America everyone is concerned about work.</p>

				<p>I was really happy, got to meet a lot of people, and made relationships. I got to know who I am as a designer while I was by myself. Learning about other cultures, styles and techniques of design, I got to reflect on what is important to me, and looking at other people’s style helped me to develop my own style.</p>

				<p>I felt like I grew. I was able to travel around Europe for 3 months. My time alone made more responsible and independent, time management, focus, how to get stuff done, arriving on time, helped me become a better person and being responsible for myself.</p>

				<p>I am pretty happy with the amount of friends I made. If I have the chance, it pretty hard since I’m school and it was hard to travel while at school. </p>

				<p>You get to spend time in different place and culures, you get to make relationships that would change you for the rest of your life.</p>
